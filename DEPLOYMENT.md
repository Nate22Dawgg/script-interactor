# Efficient MVP Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to deploy the Script Execution Platform as a fully functional MVP that can execute real scripts and store real data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) for backend development
- Basic knowledge of Docker (optional for initial deployment)
- A cloud provider account (AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean recommended)
- Domain name (optional but recommended for production)

## Development to Deployment Roadmap

### Phase 1: Implement Core Backend (1-2 days)

1. **Create Basic Backend**
   ```bash
   # Initialize a new Node.js project in the backend directory
   mkdir -p backend && cd backend
   npm init -y
   npm install express ws cors redis mongoose dotenv
   ```

2. **Implement Essential API Endpoints**
   - Create routes for script management (CRUD operations)
   - Set up proper error handling
   - Implement basic authentication if needed

3. **Connect to a Database**
   - For quick MVP, MongoDB Atlas provides a free tier
   - Set up connection in your backend code
   - Create schema for scripts, execution results, etc.

### Phase 2: Script Execution Engine (1-2 days)

1. **Build Script Executor**
   - Create an isolated environment for executing scripts
   - Start with one language (e.g. Python) to simplify
   - Use proper sandboxing (Docker containers recommended)

2. **Implement WebSocket Server**
   - Set up real-time communication for execution updates
   - Replace the simulation code with actual execution monitoring

### Phase 3: Frontend Connections (1 day)

1. **Update Frontend to Use Real API**
   - Modify API service files to connect to your real backend
   - Update WebSocket connections to use actual server
   - Test all functionality end-to-end

2. **Build Frontend**
   ```bash
   # In the root directory of the project
   npm run build
   ```

### Phase 4: Simple Deployment (1 day)

1. **Deploy Backend**
   - For quick MVP, deploy to a service like Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean App Platform
   ```bash
   # Example for deploying to Railway
   npm install -g railway
   railway login
   railway up
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Deploy to a static hosting service like Netlify or Vercel
   ```bash
   # Example for Netlify deployment
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - Update environment variables with your deployed backend URL
   - Test the complete flow in the deployed environment

## Simplified Deployment Options

### Option A: All-in-One Platform (Fastest)

Services like **Render** or **Railway** can host both your frontend and backend:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect Render/Railway to your repository
3. Set up both a web service (for backend) and static site (for frontend)
4. Add environment variables for database connection

### Option B: Separate Frontend/Backend (More Flexible)

1. **Backend**: Deploy to Render, Railway, or DigitalOcean
2. **Frontend**: Deploy to Netlify or Vercel
3. **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas free tier
4. **WebSocket**: Your backend service needs to support WebSocket connections

## Essential Configuration

When deploying, make sure to set these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URI=your_database_connection_string
CORS_ORIGIN=your_frontend_url
MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE=5MB
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=300
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Script Sandboxing**: Ensure proper isolation to prevent security issues
2. **WebSocket Connections**: Many hosting providers need specific configuration for WebSockets
3. **CORS Settings**: Configure to allow your frontend domain
4. **Resource Limits**: Start with conservative limits for script execution (memory, CPU, time)

## Testing & Monitoring

For an MVP, implement basic monitoring:

1. Use logging for all script executions
2. Set up error alerting for failed executions
3. Monitor resource usage to prevent abuse

## Scaling Later

This guide focuses on the MVP. When you need to scale:

1. Move to Docker containers for consistent deployment
2. Implement the Kubernetes setup included in the repository
3. Add Redis for job queuing and caching
4. Set up proper monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

By following this phased approach, you can have a working MVP in approximately 5 days, with the ability to execute real scripts and store real data.
